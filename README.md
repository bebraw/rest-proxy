# rest-proxy

This little proxy has been designed to be used primarily with REST interfaces. The idea is that using this you can decouple your frontend from backend more effectively. Consider the following image for the use case:

*1. FRONTEND* <-> *2. BACKEND* <-> *3. REST BACKEND*

This proxy sits there between 2. and 3.

Considered experimental!
